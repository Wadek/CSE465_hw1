Limitations of S/Key:

Secret keys must be transmitted (either manually or through a communication channel), 
and there may be a chance that an enemy can discover the secret keys during their transmission.

Authentication requires sharing of some secret and sometimes third party trust is required.  

Secruity is placed on the reversing of the cryptographic hashing functions. Meaning that once you 
obtain the algorithm, the security of the function is now useless as you can always compromise the password.
